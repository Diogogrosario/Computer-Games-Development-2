## Assets
### Sprites
All used sprits were made by the team.
### Sound effects
## Some Highlights
Since all sprites used in the development of the game were made by the team, the game features never seen before art. On top of that, every sprite is coupled with a set of animations to give a more accurate visual feedback to the player. 
### Development Highlights

The initial development was a bit slow as the team did not have much experience with unity, however, this did not last too long as the team grew accustomed with the platform relatively fast.
To make designing new levels and adjusting the enemies to their conditions, the enemies ranges and some other details were mais "Serialized", this means, these aspects could be editedfor each individual enemy. For example, the door enemy. The range in which the player is detected by this enemy can be adjusted for each instance of this enemy and the indicator above the door will also self adjust to match the new range
